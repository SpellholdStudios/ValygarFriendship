## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

One of the things many find sorely lacking in the Bioware NPCs are the more complex relationships presented by modern NPC mods--especially in regards to "*friendships*", the relationships NPCs have with the PC when not romancing them.

This mod adds a series of dialogues with Valygar.


Visit the <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/npciep">website</a> or <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/667-valygar-friendship">forum</a> for all the latest updates.

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

#### Games supported

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE), the conversion projects <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/261-bgt-weidu/">Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Gibberlings3/EET/releases">Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET)</a>.

## 

#### Other Mods Compatibility

The Valygar Friendship mod should be compatible with all WeiDU mods, however, we cannot test every single one. It is only compatible with BGII: ToB. If you do encounter an error, please let us know by posting the message at our forums.

**Known issue:** The Valygar Friendship should work fine with Corthala Romantique, but switching between romance and friendship may deactivate some dialogues. We hope to make it work better in the future version of the mod.

## 

#### Installation Order

>Although it is not required for the valygar Friendship to function properly, it is always a good idea to install the latest version of the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.

Here is the recommended installation order:
- Please install Valygar Friendship after TobEx, BG2 Fixpack, and EET.
- Please install Valygar Friendship before EET_End, and any final "biffing" routines.

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run __`setup-valygarfriendship.exe`__, un-install the previously installed main component and delete the :file_folder: valygarfriendship folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, __do not close the DOS window__ by clicking on the __X__ button! Instead, press the __Enter__ key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Valygar Friendship for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: valygarfriendship folder and a setup-valygarfriendship.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-valygarfriendship.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-valygarfriendship.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the component settings.

## 

#### Mac OS

Valygar Friendship for Mac OS is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: valygarfriendship folder, setup-valygarfriendship and setup-valygarfriendship.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-valygarfriendship.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-valygarfriendship.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

Valygar Friendship for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy weidu and weinstall to `/usr/bin`. Following that, open a terminal, **cd** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`weinstall setup-valygarfriendship`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine bgmain.exe`** (or **`wine baldur.exe`** for EE games) and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-valygarfriendship --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>
